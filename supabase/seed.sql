-- supabase/seed.sql
-- This file is executed when you run `supabase db reset` or when a new project is created.
-- It's a good place to add initial application data.
-- System/Admin user creation and profile seeding will be handled by a separate setup script.

-- Example of other seed data:
-- INSERT INTO public.your_table (column1, column2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2');
-- Add any other application-specific seed data here.
